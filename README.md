Simple Rest Api Project --@NodeJS

A Basic REST API in Node.js is a simple web service that enables clients to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations over HTTP using endpoints. It is built using Node.js and often includes the following components:

Express.js: A lightweight web framework to define routes and handle HTTP requests.
Endpoints: URLs like /api/resource for interacting with specific data resources.
Middleware: For tasks like parsing request bodies (using body-parser or built-in methods) and handling errors.
Database: Connects to a database (e.g., MongoDB or MySQL) to store and retrieve data.
JSON: Data is typically exchanged in JSON format between the client and server.
Example Features:

GET /items – Retrieve a list of items.
POST /items – Create a new item.
PUT /items/:id – Update an existing item by ID.
DELETE /items/:id – Delete an item by ID.
This structure makes the API modular, scalable, and suitable for integration with front-end or other back-end services.
